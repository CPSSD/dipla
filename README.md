## The Development Environment

### Pre-requisites

* To set up the project, you will need...
    * git
    * python 2.7
    * pip
    * virtualenv

### Setting up

Before starting, you must install `pip`, and then `pip install virtualenv`.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://www.github.com/cpssd/dipla.git`

2. Change directory to project root: `cd dipla`

3. Create your virtual environment: `virtualenv venv`

4. Activate your virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`

5. Install the project dependencies: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

You can now write code for the project!

### Notes

* If you install additional dependencies with pip, you can update the requirements file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

* Remember to deactivate the virtual environment when you're done using `deactivate`.
