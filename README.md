## Setting up the Development Environment

Before starting, you will need to have `pip` installed.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://www.github.com/cpssd/dipla.git`.

2. Change directory to project root: `cd dipla`.

3. Create your virtual environment: `virtualenv venv`.

4. Activate your virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`.

5. Install the project dependencies: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`.

You can now write code for the project!

* If you install additional dependencies with pip, you can update the requirements file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

* Remember to deactivate the virtual environment when you're done using `deactivate`.
